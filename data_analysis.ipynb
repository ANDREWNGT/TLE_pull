    "# Tool for valid launch times of a satellite A to target specific orbit plane to trail RAAN of a satellite B \n",

    "1. Pull TLE data from Celestrak\n",
    "2. Propagate target satellite B's RAAN for specified time with J2 effect\n",
    "3. Obtain RAAN target plane for satellite A to launch into \n",
    "4. Match RAAN to longitude of launch site within tolerance, correcting longitude with the angle between vernal equinox and prime meridian. \n",
    "5. Obtain time stamps when condition in step 4 are valid. These are valid launch times subject to the tolerance chosen. \n",

    "The former contains valid launch times matching the RAAN condition for T2, along with the uncertainty in RAAN purely due to the uncertainity in launch azimuth/ launch sequence which are not provided by ISRO. \n",

Since the launch site is fixed, and we know the target orbit plane we require and how it evolves over time, we are able to then match the target orbit plane's RAAN with the $RAAN_{launched}$, the RAAN from launching satellite into orbit at a certain time. The time of day and date affects the $RAAN_{launched}$, so the launch window is dependent on both the date and time of day.  \n",
